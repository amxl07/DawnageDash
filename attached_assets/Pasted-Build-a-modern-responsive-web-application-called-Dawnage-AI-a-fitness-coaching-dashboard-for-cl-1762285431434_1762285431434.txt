Build a modern, responsive web application called "Dawnage AI" — a fitness coaching dashboard for clients.

Use:

React (Vite + TypeScript preferred)

Supabase (for authentication, database, and storage)

Tailwind CSS for styling

Recharts or Chart.js for analytics

Design Reference:
Follow the modern, premium look of https://www.dawnage.com
 — clean, minimal, bold typography, and fitness-luxury tone.
Use a dark, premium fitness dashboard theme inspired by Dawnage AI.
